  {
    question: "What kinds of projects do you support?",
    answer: "Retainers and one-off projects where scope clarity matters: web builds, redesigns, content + SEO packages, analytics setups, branding, product design, etc."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you replace my team's proposal template?",
    answer: "No. We can work inside your template, or provide a clean default pack you can adapt."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need from us?",
    answer: "Rough notes + context links. If you have a prior proposal or SOW template, send that too."
  },
  {
    question: "How many revision rounds?",
    answer: "One included. Extra passes available if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you send back after the free QA pass?",
    answer: "A short list of scope-risk flags + a reusable scope-risk checklist so your team can self-check next time."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you talk to the client?",
    answer: "Optional. Most agencies prefer we draft from your notes, then you send."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the turnaround?",
    answer: "Typically 24 hours from receiving inputs."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legal advice?",
    answer: "No. We're improving clarity and consistency. You should use your own counsel for legal review."
