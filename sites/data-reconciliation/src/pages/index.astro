const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do you need access to our ad accounts?",
    answer: "Not to start. CSV exports are enough for the first pass. If it's a fit, we can add read-only access later."
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms do you support?",
    answer: "We start with 2–3 sources you already export (Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, GA4, Shopify). We expand only after the first workflow is stable."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need from me?",
    answer: "Your exports + your 'source of truth' definition (what number must match for billing/reporting)."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes mismatches?",
    answer: "Common culprits: timezones, currency, attribution windows, tracking changes, campaign naming drift, duplicated lines, missing IDs, and backfilled conversions."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast is turnaround?",
    answer: "For a first pass: usually 24–48 hours after you send exports (depends on complexity)."
  },
  {
    question: "Pricing?",
    answer: "Phase 1 is concierge: per reconciliation (weekly/monthly) with a simple fixed price once scope is clear."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle data / confidentiality?",
    answer: "Start with CSV exports only—no ad-account access required. You can redact customer PII; we only need aggregate numbers + join keys. If it's a fit, we can work under an NDA."
